# Rwanda Task Management System

A comprehensive multi-tenant task management platform for schools and companies with district-level administration, built specifically for Rwanda's administrative structure.

## 🎯 Overview

This system enables:
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with organization-level data isolation
- **District-based administration** where District Admins approve and manage organizations
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with 5 user roles
- **Secure onboarding** using organization-specific access codes
- **Task management** with assignments, submissions, and grading
- **Payment tracking** and subscription management
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for compliance

## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Roles
- **District Admin**: Main system authority per district
- **Organization Admin**: Manages internal users and classes/departments
- **Teacher/Worker**: Assigns tasks and manages groups
- **Student/Intern**: Receives and submits tasks

### Multi-Tenant Design
- Each School/Company = Tenant
- Data isolation via `organizationId`
- District-level oversight and approval

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- MySQL 8.0+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd task-manager
npm install
```

2. **Environment Setup**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials and settings
```

3. **Database Setup**
```bash
# Create database
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE rwanda_task_management;
exit

# Run migrations
npm run migrate
```

4. **Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Models
- **District**: Administrative districts
- **DistrictAdmin**: System administrators per district
- **Organization**: Schools/Companies (tenants)
- **User**: All system users with roles
- **Class**: Academic classes or work departments
- **Task**: Assignments and projects
- **Submission**: Task submissions with grading
- **Payment**: Subscription and payment tracking
- **AuditLog**: Complete activity tracking

### Key Features
- **Soft Deletes**: All models use `paranoid: true`
- **Timestamps**: Automatic `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Indexes**: Optimized for performance
- **Constraints**: Foreign keys with proper cascading

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication
```javascript
// Login endpoints
POST /api/auth/login                    // Regular users
POST /api/auth/district-admin/login     // District admins
POST /api/auth/organization-login       // Student/intern with org code
```

### Role-Based Access Control
```javascript
// Middleware usage
roleMiddleware(['organization_admin', 'teacher'])
districtScopeMiddleware  // District admin scope
organizationScopeMiddleware  // Organization scope
```

### Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
- **Account Locking**: After failed login attempts
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Input Validation**: Joi schemas for all endpoints
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking

## 🔄 System Workflows

### 1. Organization Registration Flow
1. Organization submits registration with district selection
2. Payment is made
3. Status = 'pending'
4. District Admin receives approval request
5. District Admin approves → system generates unique organization code
6. District Admin rejects → request closed
7. Organization receives code and can onboard users

### 2. User Registration Flow

**Students/Interns:**
1. Enter Organization Code
2. Enter Student/Employee ID
3. System validates ID from pre-loaded records
4. Pre-filled info displayed
5. User completes account setup

  district_id: Joi.number().integer().positive().required(),
  contact_email: Joi.string().email().required()
})
```

## 📝 API Testing

### Postman Collection
A comprehensive Postman collection is available with:
- All API endpoints
- Authentication flows

- Error scenario testing

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - District admin login
   - User login
   - Organization code login
   - Invalid credentials handling

2. **Organization Registration**
   - Valid registration
   - Duplicate name handling
   - Invalid district handling

3. **Approval Workflow**
   - Pending organization approval
   - Rejection with reason
   - Code generation

4. **RBAC Testing**
   - Role-specific access
   - Cross-organization access prevention
   - District scope enforcement
